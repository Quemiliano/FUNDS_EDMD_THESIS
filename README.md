# FUNDS_EDMD_THESIS

This thesis analyzes the allocation logic of funding dedicated to ecology and sustainable mobility development (EDMD) in Breton municipalities and proposes a predictive model to support those that have not yet benefited from this aid by 2024. The study highlights the spatial dimension of funding distribution and underscores the decisive role of data preprocessing, particularly dimension reduction, in optimizing the machine learning models used. The results reveal both the criteria influencing funding allocation and existing territorial imbalances, thus calling into question the efficiency and fairness of its distribution. Beyond this analysis, this work offers strategic perspectives for municipalities to maximize their chances of accessing funding and provides decision-makers with avenues for a fairer distribution of resources. Finally, it illustrates, through other public data reuse and enhancement projects carried out during the training, the growing role of data science as a lever for decision-making and transformation of public action.
